    <!--Add a paragraph describing what you are going to review. This should be 2-3 sentences -->
    <p> Hot Wheels World Race is the first in its series. The movie has you following Vert Wheeler a teen who recently got his
    license and comes home to a car parked in the driveway with a gps giving him coordinates to a specific location 
    He and other drivers race through different realms to get the <strong>"Wheel of power".</strong></p>
    <!--Add a H2 tag describing characters, game play, or some specific part of your review-->
        <h2>Animation</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>The movie is from 2003 and is completely CGI. This gives the scenes a unique feel to them. The animation on the cars specifically is very well done. 
        The CGI in my opinion has held up pretty well over the years but there are definitely some flaws when it come to misplaced models.
    Overall I feel like the animation is what makes World Race its identity and is what sets it apart from the series.</p> 
    <!--Add an H3 tag about a scene or character, include a quote in the paragraph-->
       <h3>Banjee</h3>   

       <p>Vert meets another driver who's name is Banjee and they are listening to someone explain how to get past an obstacle in there current race.</p>

       <p>
        <q>Lani-I know how we can do it. Iâ€™ll use my onboard computer to calculate the timing configuration of the rotation and coordinate it with the distance of the jump.</q><br>
       
        <q>Vert- Can you put that in english?</q><br>
       
         <q>Banjee- Or at least Spanish?</q><br>
